# Dev Diary

The following will be an collection of my thoughts (and frustrations) throughout the process of developing the
project

<details>

<summary><b>Chapter 0: Pre-Project</b></summary>

## Why?

Well first and foremost, **fun**. Building things has been and always will be a passion of mine, the satisfaction of
seeing something you envisioned come to life is immeasurable to me.

For this project in particular, I had grown envious of [spotify-player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player)
and wanted a similar TUI for SoundCloud, [my streaming platform of choice](https://soundcloud.com/illogicalll). I had
seen many TUIs built with Rust and figured it would be a perfect excuse to get stuck in with the language for the
first time. Although I knew I would almost definitely be in over my head, I figured it would be the perfect
environment to learn.

## Â How?

As briefly discussed above, I opted to use Rust for this project. In order to build the TUI in as simple a manner as
possible, I had a browse on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) (Rust's package registry) and came across
[tui](https://crates.io/crates/tui). Unfortunately, its last update was back in 2022. However, after a quick look I
found [ratatui](https://crates.io/crates/ratatui), a successor to tui which had been forked back in 2023 and
maintained steadily since.

In order to handle interactions with SoundCloud, I set out to use the
[official API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide). The first spanner in the works came from trying to
register my app to gain access to the API. Upon following the official documentation to a google form, it appeared
it was no longer possible to submit applications.

Instead I was instructed to use _"support channels, e.g. the chat bot"_, which was rather vague and confusing
especially since the [support section](https://developers.soundcloud.com/support) of the developers page had no such
feature.

Eventually, I dug up a
[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soundcloud/comments/1l5uxno/how_do_you_register_the_soundcloud_api/) with a
link that led me to a chatbot which helped me create a ticket with the API team. A couple days later my application
was approved and the project was finally underway!

<summary><b>Chapter 1: Auth</b></summary>

## Rust OAuth 2.1 Adventures

I had plenty of experience with APIs from previous work and projects, however this was both my first solo from-scratch
OAuth 2.1 system and my first time using Rust so it took a little while to get working. Luckily, the provided
documentation was very clear and provided great examples such as this
[collection of PKCE tools](https://example-app.com/pkce).

With my request formed, I needed a way to receive and handle the callback of the authentication process locally. To
do this I used [tiny_http](https://crates.io/crates/tiny_http/) to create a self-hosted server that would capture and
parse the server response, before passing that into a POST request back to the soundcloud server for the final token.

Then, all that was left was to define token refresh logic and a thread that would ensure that during the program's
execution the user's auth token would never expire. This implementation did mean that if the app was opened after the
token had expired the user would be put through the auth process again, but I was just excited to have working auth
and decided to investigate potential solutions to it later.

## What Next?

Once authenticated, the program will be in possession of the user's token. The plan from here was to have a separate
`api.rs` file which could access the `token` variable that would abstract the API interaction from the UI file(s).
However, with the boring auth and API setup behind me I was itching to jump into the [ratatui docs](https://ratatui.rs/)
and do some UI work.

## What do I Want This Thing to Look Like?

Having grand visions in your head can be easy, but fully capturing them and making them come to life can prove a
significant challenge (_especially when you are using a UI library you have never used in a language you just started
learning_).

With this in mind, I wanted to take things slowly so as to not end up with an unintelligble mess of code that I would
never be able to return to. In order to do this I needed to start right at the bottom.

## What Do I Never Use?

My logic here was that if I could manage to strip out everything I disliked/never used on the platform, then I would
be left with the bare minimum. This would then perfectly align with minimalism and functionalism, two key principles
in my understanding of what makes a good TUI. So, I started with a list:

- Like 90% of the homepage
  - No shade to the actual developers at soundcloud but "events near you", "curated to your taste" and "artists to
    watch out for" are just some of the many sections on the homepage that I have never once even considered interacting
    with
- The overview tab of the library
  - I am a fan of more forced navigation rather than having multiple ways to access things. I also would rather have
    something be an additional click away if it means it keeps it more organised and natural. Therefore, instead of
    having an overview page with likes amongst other things, I would much prefer to keep everything in its own
    self-titled sub-tab. The only core components to a user's library from my point of view are:
    - liked tracks
    - playlists
    - saved albums
      Tabs such as:
    - saved stations
    - followed users
    - listening history
      Do have their uses but I don't find myself using them very often. Nonetheless I will likely end up including them
      as features with a lower priority due to the fact that there would be nowhere else to view that data (other than
      the website itself of course)
- Upload
  - I'm not an artist but even if you are an artist, why would you be trying to upload your song through a TUI
    anyway lmao
- My Profile
  - This obviously has its use case but I think its far from necessary in this type of application

## What's Left?

So what does that leave us with?

- A homepage with next to nothing on it
- A feed page of the recent activity of users you follow
- A library page with multiple tabs
- A search page

Given that there was next to nothing left to display on the homepage, I just decided to just scrap it completely and
have 3 tabs (in order of usefulness):

- Library
- Search
- Feed

Content for the time being with the simplicity I had ended up with, I decided to move on to the next stage.

## Getting Something on the Screen

For all the time I had spent, the program still did nothing at this point other than authenticate (which I was still 
patting myself on the back for). To actually get something tangible my initial thought was to do some mockups. I did
come across [a great tool](https://asciiflow.com/#/) for ascii drawings, but I figured instead of spending hours on 
drawings and then scratching my head trying to implement them in a framework and language I have barely ever
used before, I would just get stuck in and see what happens. 

For some quick inspiration, I explored some of the [example apps](https://ratatui.rs/examples/apps/) on display on the 
ratatui site. In particular, the first _'Demo'_ app was particularly good at demonstrating the different possibilities, 
instantly crowding my brain with possibilities for my own TUI. While this might not be the most 'proper' approach to
things, this is a personal project so who cares lol.
